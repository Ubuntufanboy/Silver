# Silver

## Silver is a library meant for controlling sound

This project was made to have full control over all sound. This includes, recording audio, playing audio, layering audio, editing audio, and more. This was made because I was tired of not having a library to edit sound all packed into one module. 

* Plays Audio üîä
* Records Audio üéôÔ∏è
* Edits audio ‚úçÔ∏è
* And more ü•∞

## Some Examples!

```
from silver import Silver # Import
from time import sleep # Good for timing things

# Play a sound file
Silver.play(file_path)
sleep(2)
Silver.stop() # This will stop the file at it's 2 second mark

# If you want more logging output run the verbose fuction
Silver.verbose()

# Layer 2 files on top of eachother
Silver.layer(file_path)

# Stop all the layers
sleep(5)
Silver.layer_kill(2) #This doesent work. I am aware and am trying to fix it

# Let's use the restart function
Silver.play(file_path)
sleep(120)
Silver.restart()
