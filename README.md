# Silver

## Silver is a library meant for controlling sound

This project was made to have full control over all sound. This includes, recording audio, playing audio, layering audio, editing audio, and more. This was made because I was tired of not having a library to edit sound all packed into one module. 

* Plays Audio 🔊
* Records Audio 🎙️
* Edits audio ✍️
* And more 🥰

### Still in progress
